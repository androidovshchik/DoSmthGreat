A short story... It's hard for me to control my time and works which i must done. So i came up to conclusion about giving such important task for my phone to remind me what i must do at certain time

Why there is a task `word`? As for me i think that words have a great power. So this is the best weapon to fight with oneself first of all.

And about `actions`. I think it doesn't matter to specify here what action has been done because they must be similar. The primary idea is simplicity of usage and extensibility of ideas by growing count of apps.

Let's plan today a great purpose and getting closer to it everyday!

Good luck!!! :fist::smile:
